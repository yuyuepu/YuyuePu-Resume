        UCR Student<br><br>
        4 years fintess experience<br><br>
        2 years personal trainer experience<br><br>
        Adept at muscle-building, reducing fat, body reshaping, exercise rehabilitation, and exercise nutrition<br><br>

        My name is Yuyue Pu, and I am a professional personal trainer at Wills Fitness. I decided to become a personal trainer having spent years being that person who wanted desperately to stay healthy and looking good about themselves. I tried so many different ways to let my body stay shape, such as HIIT training, Bodybuilding, Athletic Training, and Cardio conditioning, etc. Those programs are all scientific and effective training to do, but ultimately I found out the hardest part of it is to persist. After talking to many awarding athletes and scientists plus hundreds of research, finally I realized that I need to train my mind before my body.<br><br>    

Training is unique and different for everyone but people have to figure out what works the best for themselves. In other words, you have to find your fit through continuous motivation while working together to reach your goals. Motivation is the key to help persist. Take me for example, I don‚Äôt like and even hate to take selfies or taken by other people because I have body image issues and I have no confidence to show myself. I have this issue for many years until one day I found a fitness Instagrammer called ‚Äúmissbecca‚Äù, her post says ‚ÄúI hope you live a life you‚Äôre proud of. If you find you‚Äôre not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again.‚Äù It bitterly hit my weakness. From that point, I start to follow her method. I took picture of myself every day after training to record the change, and look back every time when I can not hold on or want to quit. Her post and body image become my motivation for everyday training. Seeing how these methods helped to materialize my goals kept me motivated and excited. While it‚Äôs sometimes difficult to come up with your next goal, keeping at it brings great results. It allows me to find inner strength while reaching for my goals. That‚Äôs how I fall in love with it, and decide to become a personal trainer to help my clients to reach their goals.<br><br>  

With the development of today‚Äôs society, fitness is a popular method to pursue a healthy body. Wills are able to meet various customers‚Äô needs for body shaping. Helping people to find a bodybuilding method, which works best for them, is our primary goal. That‚Äôs the reason I decided to join the Wills team and start my personal trainer career.¬†I am adept at muscle-building, reducing fat, body reshaping, exercise rehabilitation, and exercise nutrition. At Wills, by using the knowledge of training and diet plan, I helped a girl, who was struggling with being overweight, to lose 30 pounds within a month. Her health had been greatly influenced by being overweight and her doctor suggests that training and diet control might be the best choice to pull through. Then she found me and told me her goal for losing weight. I made both physical training and diet plans for her. The physical training includes jumping jack, burpee, plank, crunch, etc. Besides, I provide supplemental nutritional information. I advised her to have 100 grams of carbohydrate, 150 grams of protein, and some vegetables which can be raw, toasted, or poached.¬†Able to promote fitness programs and teach my clients the ways to choose healthier habits and transform them into a lifestyle is always my career goal. Back to now during my college, I chose business administration as my major because it helps me to accumulate more business and marketing knowledge, and I want to combine those with my personal trainer experience to expand my career in the future. A gym that hatches your motivation.
